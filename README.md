Gini - Global Interconect is Not Internet
-----------------------------------------
This is a collection of ideas and maybe in time related software.

### Why?
It is resonable to asume that it will be easier to get high data throughput in a geographicly small area (short distance) and that direct or close to direct node to node communication over high throughput interconects will be faster than the internet.

Putting more communication on desentralized networks will be importaint for privacy.

High throughput interconects will open for close proximity Hardware as a Service (cpHaaS). This will be importaint for wearables like augumented reality glasses. Resource intensiv operations can be offloaded to the cpHaaS and the cpHaaS can be preloaded with area spesific data. We need to standardize how cpHaaS is broadcasted and described.

Not all sevices will be free, so we need a payment model. Something like what we have for romaing cellular networks but with more privacy. 

### Global?
